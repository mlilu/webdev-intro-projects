            <h2 style="text-align: center">Zoro</h2>
            <p class="about-cats">
              This is Zoro, named after the One Piece swordsman, he is a little
              over a year old now. He was found in an alleyway and given to me
              by a friend who couldn't care for him at the time. I was so
              excited to add him to my family, he is officially my first feline
              pet. He's a shy guy who takes time to get used to new things, but
              super sweet and cuddly once he's comfortable. Zoro is smart and
              cautious, but gets into mischeif with his friend Faye quite often.
              He loves his bird toy, dinner time, and is a master at loafing.
              He's definitley a sucker for belly rubs, and he always gets them
              because how can anyone deny that cute furry boy.

            <h2 style="text-align: center">Faye</h2>
            <p class="about-cats">
              Faye, named after another anime character, Faye Valentine from
              Cowboy Bepop, is an energetic, social girl. She has big eyes, and
              white mittens on at all times. She is very cuddly, loves
              attention, and will let you know it. She is, more often than not,
              a trouble maker in the house. It is so hard to stay mad at that
              cute face for long though. Like Zoro, Faye was given to me by a
              friend after being found in another alley. She was very cautious
              at first, but since she opened up, she has been the sweetest and
              most playful cat I've ever met. She loves butt pats and knocking
              drinks over any chance she gets.
